NodeJS Socket.IO Seed
=====================
Seed project for NodeJS+Express.

XXX After x-nodejs-socketio-ng-seed-mpe, started new repo for clean set-up.

Going to write some examples, demos, and hopefully work towards some common
structure and seed branches.

Work in progress
  Modulr 
    - fix configuration

Wanted
  - View-Controller metadata
  - Schema metadata, migration, validation at structure and datatype level.
 

Branch docs

  - Initial project structure, documentation.

  f_bootstrap
    - Going to dust off my own Du stylesheets and get bootstrap components and
      layout into the picture.

  f_client
    - Want to build lazy-loading, fully packaged client. 
      Need build-system, code and style compilers.

  f_ext
    - Try to get an extension framework going at the backend with plugin modules.

  f_backbone
